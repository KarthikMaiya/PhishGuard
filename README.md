# PhishGuard
PhishGuard v2 is a lightweight, browser-level phishing protection system designed to detect and block suspicious domains in real time. It functions as a local security layer by routing Google Chrome traffic through a controlled local proxy, analyzing each accessed domain, and presenting a security alert when potential phishing behavior is detected.
